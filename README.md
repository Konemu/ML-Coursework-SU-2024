This project report was created as mandatory course work for the lecture Machine Learning
for Physicists and Astronomers given at Stockholm University in the spring of 2024. The task
was to choose one lower and one higher complexity task from a number of presented real-world
datasets and attempt to model them using different machine learning approaches.
For the lower complexity task, I chose the superconductor dataset due to a personal
interest in solid state physics. For the higher complexity task, I went with galaxy classification
as to feature one regression and one classification task in this report.

The code for the superconductivity model can be found here:
